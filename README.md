Fooling around with the JAVA GUI library over Winter Break 2013, right after finishing a Data Structures class.

Projects include: 
----
Tic-tac-toe (JAVA GUI)  12/25/2012
Etch-A-Sketch (JAVA GUI) 1/12/2013

Tic-Tac-Toe:
- bird.java: the driver class (with main function), only contains optionpanes inquiring players' names and making the blue class object for the window.
- blue.java: the content/layout (includes actionlisteners, buttons, winner/loser determination and the scoreboards)
- mostly hard-coded (for the winner/loser determination)
- use of buttons to represent each possible "move"
- was actually my first try at using the java gui library

Etch-A-Sketch:
- hammie.java: the driver class (with main function), only to make a "cutie" object
- cutie.java: the content/layout (includes actionlisteners, labels grid)
- originally wanted this to be a base for a really short and simple rpg game, but ended up not having enough time to finish it, so I shortened it to an Etch-a-Sketch game instead. 
- future plans? maybe give the user more of a selection for picking and choosing the color combinations.
